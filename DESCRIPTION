Title: Accessing Environmental Data from ERD's ERDDAP Server
Authors@R: c(
    person("Roy", "Mendelssohn", email = "roy.mendelssohn@noaa.gov", role = c("aut","cre")),
    person("Cindy", "Bessey",  role = "ctb"),
    person("Dave", "Foley", role = "ctb"))
Description: Contains three functions that access
    environmental data from ERD's ERDDAP service <http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap>. The xtracto() function extracts
    data along a trajectory for a given "radius" around the point. The
    xtracto_3D() function extracts data in a box. The xtractogon() function
    extracts data in a polygon. There are also two helper functions to obtain
    information about available data, and plotting functions to plot the results.
